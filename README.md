# $.colorRoller

$.colorRoller is a jQuery plugin that extracts ThemeRoller colors and make them available for individual use. jQuery ThemeRoller bundles colors with other css styles, which makes it difficult to style page elements with a single color contained in a ThemeRoller theme. This plugin exposes individual colors by extracting them from ThemeRoller-generated css.

**Features:** 

 - Use individual jQuery ThemeRoller colors on your page as classes or create your own with JavaScript
 - supports scoped themes
 - init callback method supported
